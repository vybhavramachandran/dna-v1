# dna-v1

This is an opensource project by hipo.ai.

The goal of this project is to understand systems biology from a bottom-up view. The project aims to answer to question, given the right environment, can we design biological agents with intelligence* that can perform a biological task.

The first task we are targetting is DNA Transcription.

DNA Transcription is a process by which the information in a strand of DNA is copied into a new molecule of messenger RNA (mRNA). In this project, we have developed a simple environment to simulate a single-strand of DNA where the RNA-Polymerase-II(the Reinforcement learning agent) will attempt to "learn" DNA Transcription.

Goals:
- Check if the agent can learn DNA Transcription as a process without any curriculum
- Check the boundary conditions
- Given the right environment, can the agent also learn the role of epigenetics on DNA
